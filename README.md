# NasaApod

Setup:
1. Apply for a NASA API Key - https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key
2. Once you have your key, insert it into the settings.json file replacing 'DEMO_KEY' 

Instructions:
* Use outter left / right buttons to toggle between image and explanation
* Use inner left / right buttons to adjust the screen brightness
* The app will make an API call every 12 hours (New image is published every day, however it is unclear what time & timezone this happens in).
